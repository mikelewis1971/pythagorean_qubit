# Appendix: Complete Python & Qiskit Code

This appendix contains all the essential programs used throughout the course "Quantum Geometry: Simulating Energy Dynamics with Qubits." The code is categorized by topic, and each section provides clear examples and instructions to help you explore quantum circuits that simulate complex energy dynamics and interference patterns.

## 1. Installing and Setting Up Qiskit

Before running any quantum circuits, ensure you have Qiskit installed. Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install qiskit
```

**Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

To manage your Python packages without affecting your system-wide installations, create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv qiskit_env
source qiskit_env/bin/activate  # On Unix/Mac
qiskit_env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
pip install qiskit
```

You may also install additional visualization libraries like matplotlib:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
```

## 2. Creating a Basic Quantum Circuit

This example initializes a 5-qubit system and applies a Hadamard gate to each qubit, creating an equal superposition. It then measures all qubits to collapse the state to one of 32 possible outcomes.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute

# Create a quantum circuit with 5 qubits and 5 classical bits.
qc = QuantumCircuit(5, 5)

# Apply Hadamard gates to all qubits to create superposition.
for qubit in range(5):
    qc.h(qubit)

# Measure all qubits.
qc.measure(range(5), range(5))

# Visualize the circuit.
print(qc.draw(output='text'))

# Simulate the circuit.
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
result = execute(qc, simulator, shots=1024).result()
counts = result.get_counts()

# Print measurement results.
print("\nMeasurement results:", counts)
```

## 3. Implementing the Curvature-Corrected Formula

This Python function computes the modified Pythagorean theorem for both the plus and minus cases, incorporating the chirality factor \(h\).

```python
import math

def classical_distance(a, b, R, plus=True):
    """Compute the curvature-corrected hypotenuse.
    
    The formula is:
        c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ± h * (a^2 * b^2 / R^2)
    where h is represented implicitly by choosing the plus or minus branch.
    """
    correction = (a**2 * b**2) / (R**2)
    if plus:
        c_squared = a**2 + b**2 + correction
    else:
        c_squared = a**2 + b**2 - correction
    return math.sqrt(c_squared)

# Example usage:
a, b, R = 3, 4, 10
print("Hyperbolic case (+):", classical_distance(a, b, R, plus=True))
print("Spherical case (-):", classical_distance(a, b, R, plus=False))
```

## 4. Encoding the 32-State System in a Quantum Circuit

This circuit represents the 5-qubit system where each qubit corresponds to one binary choice in our curvature-corrected equation, ensuring that all 32 outcomes (including both \(h = +1\) and \(h = -1\)) are represented.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, QuantumCircuit

qreg = QuantumRegister(5, 'q')
creg = ClassicalRegister(5, 'c')
qc = QuantumCircuit(qreg, creg)

# Apply Hadamard gates to initialize an equal superposition of all 32 states.
qc.h(qreg)

# Measure all qubits.
qc.measure(qreg, creg)

# Visualize the circuit.
print(qc.draw())
```

---

## 5. Phase Shifts and Interference

This section applies phase shifts to control how the quantum states interfere, which is essential for simulating energy dynamics.

```python
from qiskit.circuit.library import U1Gate

qc = QuantumCircuit(5, 5)

# Apply Hadamard gates to all qubits.
qc.h(range(5))

# Apply a phase shift to the 5th qubit (simulating a curvature effect and influencing the chirality factor h).
phase_angle = 0.75  # Example phase angle.
qc.append(U1Gate(phase_angle), [4])

# Measure all qubits.
qc.measure(range(5), range(5))

# Draw the circuit.
print(qc.draw())
```

---

## 6. Custom Chiral Shift Operator

This example constructs a custom unitary gate to simulate a cyclic "chiral shift" of the qubit states. Such a gate can rearrange the energy configuration in our 5-qubit system.

```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit.extensions import UnitaryGate

theta = np.pi / 4
custom_matrix = np.array([[np.cos(theta), -np.sin(theta)],
                          [np.sin(theta),  np.cos(theta)]])
custom_gate = UnitaryGate(custom_matrix, label="ChiralShift")

qc = QuantumCircuit(5, 5)
qc.append(custom_gate, [4])  # Apply the custom chiral shift operator to the 5th qubit.

qc.measure(range(5), range(5))
print(qc.draw())
```

---

## 7. Running the Circuit and Visualizing Results

Use Qiskit's Aer simulator to run the circuit and visualize the measurement outcomes as a histogram.

```python
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Run the simulation.
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
result = execute(qc, simulator, shots=1024).result()
counts = result.get_counts()

# Print the measurement outcomes.
print("Measurement outcomes:", counts)

# Plot the histogram.
plot_histogram(counts)
plt.title("Measurement Distribution for a 5-Qubit Circuit")
plt.show()
```

---

## 8. Implementing a Time Evolution Model

This script simulates dynamic energy flow over multiple iterations by repeatedly applying rotation and phase gates. Each cycle represents a discrete time step, and the final measurement reveals how the interference pattern evolves.

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(5, 5)

# Apply Hadamard gates to initialize the circuit.
qc.h(range(5))

# Simulate energy evolution over 5 cycles.
for _ in range(5):
    qc.rx(np.pi/4, range(5))  # Apply a rotation to simulate time evolution.

qc.measure(range(5), range(5))

# Run and plot the results.
result = execute(qc, simulator, shots=1024).result()
counts = result.get_counts()
plot_histogram(counts)
plt.title("Time Evolution over 5 Cycles")
plt.show()
```
